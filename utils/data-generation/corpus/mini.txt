The wind whispered through the silent trees as shadows stretched across the path.
Beyond the hills, the sky burned with the orange glow of a fading sun.
A river wound lazily through the valley, carrying with it the scent of distant rain.
In the quiet village, windows glimmered with the warmth of candlelight.
Somewhere in the distance, a lone bell tolled, slow and heavy.
Time seemed to pause, holding its breath for something unseen.
